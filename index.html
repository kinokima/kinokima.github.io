                    I am currently in my second year at the University of Washington Bothell studying business and a prospective 
                    Human Centered Design and Engineering student. I want to combine my business and UX background to translate business 
                    objectives into responsible and satisfying user experiences.  
                </p>
                <p>Here are some research I have partcipated in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pathways: Mapping HCDE Career Experiences </li>
                    <li>Participatory Design with Children and Researchers</li>
                    <li>KidsTeamUW: Creepy Project</li>
                    <li>UX Skills + ____ = Leadership</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    During quarantine I have been watching Netflix, running, biking and working on research. I have been working 
                    with <strong>Jason Yip</strong> on the <em>Creepy</em> Project trying to understand what creepy technology means to kids. 
                    For my other research project I have been conducting semi structured interviews 
                    with UX Leaders to understand the pathway to leadership! I am currently looking for more research experience for the summer

                    I am currently a sophomore at the University of Washington Bothell studying Computer Science &
                    Software Engineering. In my free time I enjoy watching sports and playing video games.

                    During the quarantine, I've been catching up on a lot of TV shows. I recently started watching a show on
                    Netflix called <em>Trailer Park Boys.</em> If you are into comedy I would totally recommend this show to you.
                    I've also had the chance in playing some new video games such as Warzone and Valorant.

                <p>
                    Learning languages such as Java, C#, & C++, I've always wanted to learn HTML and CSS. When I was selecting courses
                    for this quarter, I was so glad that UWB offered a class that highlighted the basics of HTML and CSS. With the skills
                    I learned from this class, I hope to make a basic website in the future to showcase some of my work from my classes taken
                    here at UWB.
