                    I am currently a sophomore at the University of Washington Bothell studying Computer Science &
                    Software Engineering. In my free time I enjoy watching sports and playing video games.

                <p>Here are some of the music artists I listen to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kanye West</li>
                    <li>Jay-Z</li>

                <p>
                    During the quarantine, I've been catching up on a lot of TV shows. I recently started watching a show on
                    Netflix called <em>Trailer Park Boys.</em> If you are into comedy I would totally recommend this show to you.
                    I've also had the chance in playing some new video games such as Warzone and Valorant.

                <p>
                    Learning languages such as Java, C#, & C++, I've always wanted to learn HTML and CSS. When I was selecting courses
                    for this quarter, I was so glad that UWB offered a class that highlighted the basics of HTML and CSS. With the skills
                    I learned from this class, I hope to make a basic website in the future to showcase some of my work from my classes taken
                    here at UWB.

                        I am interested in computer networking and home automation. In my free time I like to game, make
                        music, or just sleep. During this quarantine, I am trying to learn how to play Chopin's
