                        I am interested in computer networking and home automation. In my free time I like to game, make
                        music, or just sleep. During this quarantine, I am trying to learn how to play Chopin's 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturne_in_C-sharp_minor,_Op._posth._(Chopin)">
